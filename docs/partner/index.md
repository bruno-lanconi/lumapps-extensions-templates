## Enroll in the Developer program

Before you can start creating extensions, you need to be part of the LumApps Developer Program. If this is not yet done, [request to enroll in the LumApps developer program](https://developer.lumapps.com/register). Once you have filled out and submitted the form, if your request is accepted, you will receive an email. Inside this email, you need to click the link asking to create your secure and private development environment. This is where you will register your partner organization.

### Rejected requests

We may reject your request to enter the LumApps developer program for several reasons:

-   Your project cannot be done with the LumApps Marketplace.
-   We could not verify the information you set (company website not found, company name and website do not match, etc.).
-   The email domain does not match the company URL provided.

## Register your Partner organization

Once you are enrolled in the developer program, you need to create a Partner Organization. A Partner Organization is your identity on the LumApps Marketplace. The Partner Organization is listed as the owner of the extensions you create.

To register your Partner Organization, you must create a platform dedicated to test your marketplace extensions. For the test platform, we need several pieces of information:

| Information                  | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Datacenter                   | Choose where your information is hosted: Europe or USA.                         |
| Company's website            | Link to your company's website.                                                 |
| Company's name               | Name of your company.                                                           |
| Company's contact            | Your support email address to be contacted by LumApps or customers for support. |
| Icon for your company        | URL to the logo of your company.                                                |
| Description of your company  | Describe what your company does in a few words.                                 |
| Platform administrator name  | First and last name of your first global administrator for this test platform.  |
| Platform administrator email | Email of your first global administrator for this test platform.                |

> **Note:** You will be able to add more global administrators later on.

LumApps uses the information to register your Partner Organization in the LumApps Marketplace and to generate your test platform. Once the form submitted, we will send an email with all the necessary information to start working on your extensions.

## Manage your partner organization

You need to contact the LumApps Marketplace support team if you want to edit any of your Partner Organization information.
