## Tailor your LumApps experience to your own needs
Because every company is different, the LumApps off-the-shelf integrations might not satisfy all of your requirements. The LumApps marketplace program exists to assist you in creating and designing custom integrations within a constrained time and budget. 

LumApps offers a dedicated environment for your IT department or partners to create "connecting links" to your preferred employee services or business apps. All of your extensions will blend perfectly with the rest of you platform's design and aesthetic thanks to our toolset.
