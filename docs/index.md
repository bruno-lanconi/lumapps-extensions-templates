## Your integrations developed in a few days with LumApps SDK

## Extend your LumApps platform to your own needs
Each organization being unique, LumApps off-the-shelf integrations may not be able to cover specific needs and a custom connector to a business app, tool or service is then required.
That’s why LumApps provides a secure software development environment for IT teams (customer’s own IT department or IT consulting firms) to craft dedicated integrations, within a limited time and budget, in total compliance with your platform look and feel, using our robust Software Development Kit (SDK).
We provide your IT partners (be it internal or external contractor) with flexibility and security and a dedicated environment for them to develop specific / customized “connecting links” to your preferred business applications or to add specific employee services to your LumApps employee experience platform.
