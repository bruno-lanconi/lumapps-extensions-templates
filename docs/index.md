## What is a LumApps extension?
A LumApps extension is a small application that sits inside LumApps and communicates with LumApps and/or an external service to extends LumApps capabilities.
For example, the countdown widget extension lets users use a new widget in their pages to display a countdown.

## What can I do with an extension?
LumApps extensions let you interact with the LumApps platform. You can extend the LumApps platform in three different ways.

| Extension type | Capabilities                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**    | Extends LumApps without any user interface. It can be a script that consumes LumApps API.                        |
| **Share To**   | Extends the share capabilities in LumApps.                                                                       |
| **Widget**     | Provides new widgets to LumApps users. Widgets are UI components in a page used to display information to users. |
