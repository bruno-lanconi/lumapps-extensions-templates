For both local and LumApps test, extensions are visible only to a developer-provided list of test accounts and a small subset of LumApps accounts. Other users cannot access your extension.

## Local test

Every version of every extension begins with local test on the playground. The playground emulates a LumApps site to let you render and connect your extension. From the playground, you can test all parts of your extension and see if everything works as expected.

> **Note:** If you are working locally in the playground, you do not need to declare an identifier for your extension.

You can use some options to test different capabilities of a LumApps platform such as the **Theme switcher** to visualize your extension with a light or dark Theme, or a language field to test the translations of your extension. For more information on the Playground interface, see the [Tools documentation](../tools/index.md).

## LumApps test

When you are satisfied with your extension locally, you can deploy it on your LumApps test platform to see it in context. This deployment is done in your developer portal.

On your test platform, you will need to install the extension before you can use it. Once it is installed, you can add it to a piece of content to ensure everything is working as expected inside a LumApps platform. For more information, see [Custom built extensions](https://docs.lumapps.com/docs/expand-l6014157339667398marketplace-custom_built).
