## Update an extension
To update an extension after it has been released, you can:
 - Update the basic information. The extension name, description, and logo.
 - Update the extension itself.

### Update the extension's information
To update the extension's information you have to use the LumApps extensions playground.
In the administration panel of your playground, you can list the extensions you already deployed on your LumApps test platform. From there you can edit the extension's information.

If your extension has already been released, you will have to ask for extension update to let LumApps staff update the information in the production version of your extension.

### Update extension
To update your extension after editing your extension itself, or fixing issues, you'll have to resubmit a new version of your extensions. So you'll have to deploy your extension in your LumApps test platform and ask for a new review.

## Delete an extension
If you decide to stop supporting your extension, you can ask for deletion. We will delete your extension from the production. Your extension will no longer be visible and usable by LumApps users.
You can delete a specific version of an extension.
