## Update an extension

To update an extension after it has been released, you can:

-   Update the basic information. The extension name, description, and logo.
-   Update the extension itself.

### Update the extension's information

To update the extension's information, you have to use the LumApps developer portal.

### Update extension

To update your extension after editing your extension itself, or fixing issues, you'll have to resubmit a new version of your extension. So you'll have to deploy your extension in your developer portal and ask for a new review.

## Delete an extension

If you decide to stop supporting your extension, you can ask for deletion. We will delete your extension from the production. Your extension will no longer be visible and usable by LumApps users. You can also delete a specific version of an extension.
